# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains all data-related files for the PROTACFold project, including model inputs, evaluation results, and benchmark data.

## Subdirectories:

### 1. `af3_input/`
Stores input files for AlphaFold 3, organized by molecule type.
- **`protacs/`**: Contains JSON input files for PROTAC molecules, with both SMILES (`*_smiles.json`) and CCD (`*_ccd.json`) representations.
- **`molecular_glues/`**: Contains JSON input files for molecular glue molecules, also in SMILES and CCD formats.

### 2. `af3_results/`
Contains the consolidated evaluation outputs from AlphaFold 3 predictions.
- **`af3_results.csv`**: The primary CSV file generated by `evaluation.py` for AlphaFold3 predictions, containing detailed metrics like RMSD, DockQ, and confidence scores.
- **`combined_results.csv`**: A merged CSV file that combines evaluation data from AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1 for comparative analysis. This is the recommended file for future analysis as it is the most maintained and contains the latest results.

### 3. `boltz1_results/`
Contains the consolidated evaluation outputs from Boltz-1 predictions.
- **`boltz1_results.csv`**: The primary CSV file generated by `evaluation.py` for Boltz-1 predictions, containing a similar set of metrics as `af3_results.csv`.

### 4. `plots/`
Contains generated visualizations comparing model performance.
- **`PDBID_Results/`**: A key subdirectory containing plots grouped by PDB ID.
  - **`AF3/`**: Images of individual PDB IDs RMSD and DockQ plots for AlphaFold3 predictions.
  - **`Boltz-1/`**: Images of individual PDB IDs RMSD and DockQ plots for Boltz-1 predictions.

### 5. `hal_04732948/`
Contains data from the study by [Pereira et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.19.585735v2), used for benchmarking and comparison.
- **`hal_results.csv`**: The main data from the paper.
- **`AF3_DIMERS/`**: JSON files with docking quality scores for dimer predictions.
- **`AF3_CONTEXT/`**: JSON files with docking quality scores for predictions made with additional context.
